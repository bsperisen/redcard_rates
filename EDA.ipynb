    "In this data challenge we are going to analyze a dataset that comes from a fascinating paper published with commentary in Nature. The core question of the paper is reflected in the title, “Many analysts, one dataset: Making transparent how variations in analytical choices affect results”. The authors recruited around 30 analytic teams who were each tasked with the same research question: “Are soccer referees more likely to give red cards to dark skin toned players than light skin toned players?” and given the same data. The dataset came from the players who played in the 2012–13 European football (soccer) professional leagues. Data about the players’ ages, heights, weights, position, skintone rating, and more were included. The results from the teams were then compared to see how the different ways of looking at the dataset yielded different statistical conclusions. Explore the data and try to answer the posed question."
